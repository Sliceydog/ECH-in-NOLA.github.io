Goal: We are inspired by The We Play center's mission: "to offer a safe place to play while engaging in activities that promote brain development." 
Melanie Richardson expressed a need for statistical evidence of We Play's importance. 
Although we would like to use the center's existing data, it does not have enough volume for us to feel that our analysis would provide valid insight. 
Instead we would like to validate the center's work by showing how We Play fills in a educational gap for families that cannot afford to send their children to for profit child care centers.


Collaboration Plan: Rena and Eddy will utilize this repository to simultaneously edit the project. 
We plan on connecting over Zoom as needed and keeping constant communication over instant message. 
When convinient, we will export notebooks to Google Colabs to support simultaneous editing. 
(This is easily done using a Colabs Chrome extension).
